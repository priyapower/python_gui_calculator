For a given array of numbers, calculate the sums of each pair of numbers.


def method
  sum_array = 0 O(1) - just storage
  loop O(n)
    select two elements O(1) - we know where these elements are
    add two elements O(1) - just math
    store sum in new array O(1) - just storage
  result of sum_array O(1)

AT LEAST O(n)
